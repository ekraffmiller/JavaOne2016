  Lautenberg on 
Senate Passage of Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Legislation 
D.C. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ)  made the following 
statement in response to Senate passage of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) relief provision: 
s passage of the alternative minimum tax relief bill takes us one step closer to tax relief 
for more than one million hard-working, middle-class New Jerseyans. The AMT has expanded far beyond 
its original scope and threatens too many families in our state and nationwide. ###
