 
Reacts to President Bush's Veto of Embryonic Stem Cell Research Legislation 
 United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg 
(D-NJ) issued the following statement  after President Bush vetoed H.R. 810 â The Stem Cell 
Research Enhancement Act, which would have expanded federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. 
âBefore , President Bush had never vetoed a bill. It is astounding that he would use his first 
veto on a bill that could save millions of lives. With his veto, President Bush chose politics over 
people. The Scopes trial took place in 1925. Sadly, President Bushâs veto  shows that we havenât 
progressed much since then. The United States cannot enter the 21st Century believing the Earth 
is flat. We need to celebrate science in this nation â not reject it. With a stroke of a pen , 
President Bush undermined common sense. The President proved he is captive to ideologues and extremists 
in his political party. What the President did  was not compassionate, nor even conservative. 
It was an extreme action and history will hold him accountable.â?
