 
Releases 'Medigate' Report Highlighting Scandals and Misconduct Around New Medicare Law Tuesday, 
 During a news conference , United States Senator Frank R. 
Lautenberg released a report highlighting the scandals and potential laws broken by Bush administration 
officials that has plagued the new Medicare law. Senator Lautenberg was joined by Senators Hillary 
Clinton (D-NY) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA). "The bill that started out as Medicare, has now turned 
into Medigate. This law is the most scandal-plagued piece of legislation I have seen in my decades 
in Washington," said Senator Lautenberg. The Lautenberg Medigate report gives a detailed timeline 
of the scandals and misconduct of the Medicare prescription drug bill from June of 2003 up through 
. It also catalogues the criminal and civil laws that were potentially broken in the consideration 
and now implementation of the Medicare law. "Rather than actually craft a strong bill to provide 
seniors with prescription drugs, the Administration and its allies decided to play political 
games by forcing a bill through Congress utilizing some of the most questionable tactics ever seen 
on Capitol Hill," said Lautenberg. "The Bush Administration hid $139 billion in additional costs 
from the American people so they could get the flawed bill passed," said Lautenberg. The Medigate
