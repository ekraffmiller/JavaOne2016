  Lautenberg and 
Menendez Announce $98 Million for Hudson-Bergen Line Phase II on Track to be Completed in 2006 Monday, 
June 26, 2006 WASHINGTON, D.C. â Expansion of the Hudson-Bergen light rail line will continue 
on track to be completed ahead of schedule, thanks to $98 million in federal funds announced by U.S. 
Senators Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez. The grant from the Federal Transit Administration 
is part of a $500 million federal commitment that Senator Lautenberg secured in 2000 for Phase II 
of the Hudson-Bergen line. The expansion is adding six miles and seven new stations to the line, 
which will soon extend to North Bergen and Union City. âThe Bergen-Hudson line is improving the 
quality of life in communities from Bayonne to Weehawken,â? said Senator Lautenberg. âWith 
gas prices at a record high, Bob Menendez and I will continue working to provide more transportation 
choices for New Jerseyans.â? âThis project is good for our economy, itâs good for our environment, 
and itâs good for New Jersey families,â? said Senator Menendez. The Bergen-Hudson line opened 
in 2002, serving 16 stations along nine miles near the Hudson River. Federal funds contributed 
$700 million of Phase I construction. Phase II, which is projected to more than triple daily ridership 
on the line, began in 2001 and is expected to be completed ahead of schedule by the end of 2006. A third 
phase is planned to extend the system into Bergen County.
