  Lautenberg Announces 
Over $3 Million in Federal Funds for Child Immunization Tuesday, April 8, 2003 WASHINGTON, D.C. 
- United States Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) announced  federal grants from the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services. These grants will be used to provide vaccinations to many children 
throughout New Jersey. "We are investing in the protection of our children's health," said Lautenberg. 
"By working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, New Jersey will continue to protect 
children from vaccine-preventable disease that not long ago, disabled and killed a great number 
of people." The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, the United States government's principal 
agency for protecting the health of all Americans, has made $3,822,597 of grants available to the 
New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services. The latest grants have been designed to fund 
immunization and vaccines for children. "Measles, a common disease that can be fatal to children 
and adults, has been reduced by ninety five percent in the U.S. through immunizations, but it remains 
rampant in the rest of the world," said Lautenberg. "This is the kind of prevention that we need to 
cultivate with other potentially fatal diseases."
