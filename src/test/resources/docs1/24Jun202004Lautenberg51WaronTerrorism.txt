 
Introduces Legislation to Compensate Soldiers Forced to Extend Military Service Thursday, June 
During a press conference , United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg 
(D-NJ) announced legislation to provide a monthly bonus to those troops who have been trapped in 
the Pentagon "Stop Loss" policy and forced to extend their military service. The Army's current 
Stop Loss policy, announced on June 2, 2004, will keep approximately 10,000 troops, including 
thousands of National Guard and Reservists, beyond the end of their enlistment or service obligation. 
Many of these men and women have already been away from their jobs and families for an extended period, 
resulting in financial and personal hardship. "The President calls his decision to delay the discharge 
of these soldiers a 'Stop Loss'. I call it 'going back on your word'," Lautenberg said. "We know that 
many of these soldiers who have been called back to fight are from the National Guard and Reserves. 
Many of them have already been away from their families and their full time jobs for over a year." 
The Lautenberg amendment is simple and straightforward. It will provide any service member caught 
in the President's Stop Loss policy a monthly bonus of $2,000 for each additional month of service 
beyond the end of their service term. "These soldiers are being forced to bear the burden of the Pentagon's 
miscalculations," said Senator Lautenberg. "And it's not right." "While the richest among us 
have been rewarded with tax cuts, soldiers, sailors, marines, air men and women and their families 
are living paycheck to paycheck. This not the way it should be," said Senator Lautenberg, "I plan 
to force the Senate to vote on whether we will be fair to our troops and their families." Senator Lautenberg 
introduced his legislation , and plans to offer it as an amendment to the Department of Defense 
Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2005, which could be on the Senate floor for consideration 
as early as .
