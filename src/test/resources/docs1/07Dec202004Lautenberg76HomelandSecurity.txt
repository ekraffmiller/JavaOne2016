  Statement from 
Senator Lautenberg on Agreement over 9-11 Reform Legislation Tuesday, December 7, 2004 WASHINGTON, 
DC -- 9-11 Reform bill negotiator United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) issued the following 
statement  on an apparent deal between House and Senate Conferees on the final conference 
report to overhaul the nation's intelligence services. "The delay in passing this bill was unnecessary 
and unwise," said Senator Lautenberg. "Every day the House Republicans dragged this out was a day 
that made our communities less safe. While the President was eventually able to push this agreement 
through, it took him far too long." "As a conferee on this legislation, I am proud of what we produced. 
With this bill in law, I am confident that our intelligence services will be more effective in detecting 
and preventing terrorist threats. However, without the hard work and persistence of the 9-11 families 
I don't think we could have arrived at this point," Lautenberg said.
