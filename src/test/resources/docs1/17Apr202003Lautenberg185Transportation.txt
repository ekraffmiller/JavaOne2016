  Lautenberg Announces 
Federal Funds for Millstone Valley Byway Grants Part of Dept. of Transportation Program Thursday, 
April 17, 2003 WASHINGTON, D.C. Ã¢ U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg  announced funding of 
$135,176 from the Department of Transportation's Scenic Byways program for the Millstone Valley 
Byway in Somerset County. "This grant will identify strategies and possible actions to preserve, 
protect and enhance the historical, natural and scenic characteristics of the byway, while improving 
access to recreational activities and guiding the traveler through the corridor," said Lautenberg. 
Grants from the National Scenic Byways program enable states to undertake eligible projects along 
highways designated as All-American Roads, National Scenic Byways and state-designated byways. 
Eligible under this program are planning projects to inventory, preserve and enhance the qualities 
of a byway, to improve safety, to construct bike and pedestrian facilities, to develop visitor 
information such as brochures and interpretive facilities and scenic overlooks, and to protect 
these resources by such means as scenic easements and byway marketing. The Millstone Valley Byway 
is one of 206 projects in 42 states that will share $24 million in Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) scenic byways grants. This funding helps recognize, preserve and enhance America's roads 
and highways throughout the United States.
