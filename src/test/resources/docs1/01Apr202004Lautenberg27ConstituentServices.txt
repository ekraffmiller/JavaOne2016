 
Announces $250 Thousand for Police Officers in Schools Programs From Office of Community Oriented 
Policing Services (COPS) U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg 
announced  $250,000 in federal funding for Hamilton Township, Atlantic County to hire two 
police officers assigned to primary or secondary schools. Funding will go towards salary and benefits 
for the period of three years. "This program will help prevent school violence and implement educational 
programs to improve student and school safety," said Senator Lautenberg. While the specific duties 
of an officer are determined locally based on the needs of the community, an officer's presence 
on campus deters crime and violence, and provides an immediate response to occurrences that cannot 
be prevented. Many officers also participate in classroom instruction on state and local laws, 
substance abuse, and driver education, or become involved in extracurricular activities that 
enable them to serve as a role model for students who might not otherwise have positive interactions 
with law enforcement. Each officer is trained on school safety issues ranging from developing 
emergency response plans and conducting safety assessments of schools, to child development 
and cultural fluency. "These law enforcement officers make a difference in the community by serving 
as law-related educators, problem-solvers, and community liaisons," said Senator Lautenberg.
