Department of Education U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg 
announced  $128 thousand in federal funding under the Fulbright-Hays Group Projects Abroad 
Program to support overseas projects in training, research, and curriculum development in modern 
foreign languages and area studies for groups of teachers, students, and faculty engaged in a common 
endeavor. Projects may include short-term seminars, curriculum development, or group research 
or study. The following projects will receive funding: Paul Robeson Cultural Center, Rutgers 
University, New Brunswick $63,000 The Paul Robeson Cultural Center will collect cultural materials 
to be used in classrooms throughout the tri-state area. Fifteen Social Studies teachers will travel 
to Swaziland, Africa for five weeks to develop a series of demonstrative videotapes illustrating 
aspects of daily life, classroom and work life, and general culture. Rutgers University, New Brunswick 
$65,000 "Let's look back: 10th Anniversary of the End of Apartheid in South Africa" is a thirty-day 
seminar for fifteen participants to explore the historical, socio-cultural, educational and 
political systems of the KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape regions of South Africa. Among the planned 
activities are lectures, visits to a variety of schools, participation in school and community 
development projects, and visits to important historical and cultural arenas. After the program, 
each participant will be responsible for developing a project or product which may be disseminated 
to other teachers throughout the 600+ school districts in New Jersey. "These are valuable programs 
that harness field experience that will allow professors to bring that back to the classroom and 
engage students in Africa's rich historical and cultural aspects," said Senator Lautenberg.
