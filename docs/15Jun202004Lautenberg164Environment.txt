  Senators Lautenberg 
and Corzine Announce 800 Thousand Dollars for Brownfield Sites in New Jersey Tuesday, June 15, 
, United States Senators Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Jon S. Corzine 
(D-NJ) announced $800,000 in new federal grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
for three Brownfield sites in New Jersey. The three grants will go to help revitalize blighted areas 
in Essex County, Roselle and Trenton. Officials of these three municipalities will determine 
how best to use these grants to assist in the clean up of Brownfield sites it their areas. "In order 
to effectively clean up these contaminated sites federal investment is essential. These grants 
will help clean up the neighborhoods where families live, and they will create much needed jobs 
and stimulate the economy," said Senator Lautenberg. "Brownfield redevelopment is one of the 
most important tools we have to bring economic activity back to blighted areas by creating jobs, 
increasing tax revenues and cleaning up pollution. There are thousands of Brownfield sites throughout 
our state, and it is essential that the federal government partner with the state and counties and 
municipalities to foster clean ups and redevelopment," said Senator Corzine. Brownfield sites 
are not heavily contaminated Superfund-type sites. Often they are moderately or lightly contaminated 
industrial and commercial sites that could be productively re-used if cleaned up. In addition, 
investment in the cleanup of these sites creates jobs, and preserves green space and open land. 
There are potentially one million Brownfield sites in the United States, and at least 10,000 in 
New Jersey. EPA has estimated that remediation costs for all these sites exceed $650 billion. The 
Chamber of Commerce estimates that, at the current rate of cleanup, it could take 10,000 years to 
clean up these properties
