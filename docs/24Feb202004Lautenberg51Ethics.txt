 
Blasts Republican Leadership for 'Hiding Their Heads in the Sand' Over Abuses By Halliburton  
United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), a frequent 
critic of the Halliburton government contracts in Iraq, issued the following statement  
in reaction to the decision by the Defense Department to open up a criminal probe into charges of 
fraud and over-billing by Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root. "The Republicans in 
Congress can no longer hide their heads in the sand about Halliburton. Both the Treasury Department 
and the Department of Defense have opened up major investigations against Halliburton, yet the 
Congress has remained silent. We are the keepers of the taxpayers' dollars and we have an obligation 
to find out the facts. Just letting the Executive Branch investigate itself is irresponsible."
