  Lautenberg Blasts 
Bush Veto Threat On Amtrak House Takes Up Legislation , Bringing Historic Initiative Step 
Closer To Law  
D.C. , Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the lead sponsor of the Senate Amtrak Revitalization 
bill called President Bushs threat to veto that bill outrageous. Lautenbergs bipartisan bill 
the Senate by a vote of 70 22 in October. With soaring gas prices, higher airline ticket prices and 
congestion on our roads, it is absolutely outrageous that President Bush would continue his hostility 
to energy-efficient rail service in our country, said Lautenberg, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee 
on rail. The Houses consideration of this legislation signals quite clearly that people want travel 
alternatives and a healthy Amtrak for the future. President Bush needs to wake up and realize that 
people are sick and tired of paying too much for gas, sitting in traffic and being delayed on airline 
flights. Later , the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up a companion measure 
to Sen. Lautenbergs Amtrak bill. Once the House passes its measure, it will be conferenced with 
Lautenbergs Senate measure and prepared for a final text that will be approved by the Senate and 
House, and then sent to the President. The President needs to put his veto pen away and provide some 
relief to the traveling public, said Lautenberg. May 2008 was the highest-single month in Amtrak 
history. Ridership in May totaled 2.6 million passengers, an increase of 12.3 percent from May 
2007. Along the Northeast Corridor, ridership on Amtrak regional trains increased 12.4 percent. 
Trains in the Northeast provide critical service to New Jerseyans who are traveling for both work 
and pleasure.
