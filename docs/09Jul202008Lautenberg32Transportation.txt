  Lautenberg Introduces 
Bill To Stop Illegal Drug Smuggling Aboard Elusive, Low-Cost Submarines Bill to Aid U.S. Coast 
Guard in Preventing Illegal Drug Shipments to the U.S. 
 U.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) has introduced bipartisan 
legislation to aid the U.S. Coast Guard and other law enforcement agencies in the fight against 
illegal drug and weapons smuggling by making the operation of unregistered submarines unlawful. 
These low-profile ships sit just below the top of the water and have become an innovative and preferable 
method of transport for smuggling drugs and other illegal substances into the country. Such ships 
can travel approximately 2,000 miles while going at speeds faster than six knots. They can measure 
up to 80 feet in length, and can carry up to 12 metric tons of cargo. Federal drug interdiction agencies 
believe these submarines are responsible for one-third of all maritime cocaine shipments between 
the Americas, and that figure is increasing. It is projected that they will account for 480 metric 
tons of cocaine shipped in Fiscal Year 2009. Too many unregistered ships bring illegal drugs to 
our shores and our neighborhoods. Our bill will close this loophole and help prevent the overseas 
trafficking of illegal drugs, weapons and other dangerous contraband, Sen. Lautenberg said. 
Our legislation will provide an essential tool for law enforcement officers to prevent this illegal 
smuggling. Federal law enforcement authorities are urgently seeking the enactment of legislation, 
like Sen. Lautenbergs bill (S. 3198), to criminalize operating these unregistered ships on an 
international voyage. Sen. Lautenberg serves as chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation 
Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security, 
which has jurisdiction over maritime transportation standards and security.
