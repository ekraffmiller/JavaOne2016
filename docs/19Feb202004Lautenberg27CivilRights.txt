  Senator Lautenberg: 
A Pattern of Discrimination by Bush Admin. Officials Against Gay and Lesbian Federal Employees 
Continues Lawmakers Send Letter to Bush Calling on Him to Address the Situation Thursday, February 
 United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ)  joined several 
of his fellow lawmakers in condemning a top Bush administration official for deliberately removing 
all references to sexual orientation from the federal employee awareness section of the Office 
of Special Counsel's (OSC) website. "The intolerance and discrimination we have seen from the 
Bush administration against gay and lesbian Americans is astounding, and anything but compassionate," 
said Senator Lautenberg, referring to actions by Special Counsel Scott Bloch who ordered the removal 
off ALL references to sexual orientation from the section of OSC website that provides awareness 
and compliance information for federal employees. "Every federal employee regardless of race, 
religion, creed, gender or sexual orientation must be afforded the same rights and be treated with 
equal respect by our government," Senator Lautenberg said. Last year, United States Senator Frank 
R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) invited the Department of Justice's gay and lesbian employee group, DOJPride, 
to the Capitol to host their annual celebration when it was reported that Attorney General John 
Ashcroft and the Department of Justice denied the group from holding their annual event on the premises.
