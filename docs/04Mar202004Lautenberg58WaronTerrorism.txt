 
Calls on President Bush to Stop Running 9-11 Political Ads  
D.C. Ã¢ In a letter sent , United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg called on President Bush 
to immediately pull campaign ads that use tragic images from 9-11. Lautenberg called the ads demeaning 
and told the President they dishonored those that died as well as the loved ones they left behind. 
"I urge you to direct your campaign to immediately withdraw these advertisements. I believe that 
all of us who run for elective office must maintain standards of dignity and respect that prevent 
us from exploiting national tragedies for political purposes," wrote Lautenberg in his letter 
to President Bush. "Using images from that horrific and tragic event for political ends demeans 
and dishonors those who died and the families who lost loved ones on that day," Lautenberg wrote. 
Full Text of the Letter Follows: March 4, 2004 Dear Mr. President, As you may know, over 700 of my constituents 
died in the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001. I am writing to you  to express my concern 
over your use of images from that terrible event in political campaign advertisements. Using images 
from that horrific and tragic event for political ends demeans and dishonors those who died and 
the families who lost loved ones on that day. I urge you to direct your campaign to immediately withdraw 
these advertisements. I believe that all of us who run for political elective office must maintain 
standards of dignity and respect that prevent us from exploiting national tragedies for political 
purposes. Sincerely, Frank R. Lautenberg
