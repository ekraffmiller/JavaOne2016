  More Than $259 
Million For New Jersey Secured By Lautenberg & Menendez Passes Key Senate Committee Funds ParThursdayof Transportation, Energy and Water, Financial Services Appropriations Bills 
, the Senate Appropriations 
Committee approved more than $259 million in federal funding for critical projects in New Jersey 
supported by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), a member of the committee, and Sen. Robert Menendez 
(D-NJ). The funds are part of three separate FY 2009 spending bills the Appropriations Committee 
approved: the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill; the Energy 
and Water Development Appropriations bill; and the Financial Services Appropriations bill. 
These bills must be approved by both the Senate and House of Representatives before they can be signed 
into law by the President. President Bush has threatened to veto these bills. These bills include 
measures to modernize our public transportation systems, give commuters more travel options, 
help keep cars off the road and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. These bills would also strengthen 
our infrastructure, protect our communities from flooding and invest in alternative energy sources. 
These funds are critical to New Jerseys economy and environment, and I am proud to have helped take 
this important step to secure them, Sen. Lautenberg said. The economic downturn is hitting New 
Jerseys families, and we must work to provide relief to commuters and help break our dependence 
on oil, said Sen. Menendez. With gas prices hitting record highs, this funding will help address 
our energy crisis by upgrading our transportation system and investing in renewable energy. It 
will also help preserve our states economic and environmental treasure our beaches. We are calling 
on President Bush to reconsider his stance so that we can bring relief to commuters, help build a 
green economy, and protect the Jersey Shore. New Jersey would receive $86,503,000 in funds under 
the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill. New Jersey projects 
in the bill are: $75,000,000 to NJ Transit for the Trans-Hudson Midtown Corridor tunnel; $1,104,000 
to NJ Transit for the second segment of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail; $3,000,000 to the NJ Department 
of Transportation (NJDOT) for I-295/76/42 Direct Connection in Camden County; $2,000,000 to 
NJ Transit for Bloomfield Intermodal Improvements; $500,000 for Stevens Institute of Technology 
for the Hudson Waterfront Walkway; $1,000,000 for the redesign of College Avenue in New Brunswick; 
$1,000,000 for the Lakewood Township Multi Modal Facility; $1,000,000 to Salem County for Short 
Line Railroad Rehabilitation; $1,000,000 to 180 Turning Lives Around in Monmouth County for the 
construction of a new domestic violence shelter; $200,000 for Cathedral Soup Kitchen in Camden 
to construct a new facility; $300,000 for the YMCA of Eastern Union County to renovate its social 
service facility; and $400,000 for Hudson County for the redevelopment of Koppers Coke Brownfield 
Site. The bill also includes a Lautenberg provision that requires the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) to report to Congress within 60 days of a General Accountability Office (GAO) report on the 
New Jersey-New York-Philadelphia airspace redesign. Both Sens. Lautenberg and Menendez have 
been strong critics of the redesign plan, and list it as one of the reasons they placed a hold on the 
acting FAA administrators nomination to run the FAA permanently. New Jersey would receive $171,866,000 
in funds under the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. Some of the New Jersey projects

for beach replenishment in Ocean City; $3,000,000 for beach replenishment in Avalon; $2,000,000 
for beach replenishment from Sandy Hook to Barnegat Inlet; and $85,000,000 for New York and New
