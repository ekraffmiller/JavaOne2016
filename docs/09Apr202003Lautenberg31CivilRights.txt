  Lautenberg Calls 
Comments By Education Secretary Rod Paige 'Hurtful' Wednesday, April 9, 2003 WASHINGTON, D.C. 
- United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) issued the following statement  in response 
to remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Education Rod Paige that were seen by many as religiously intolerant. 
"Such a narrow-minded statement from the U.S. Secretary of Education is unacceptable. The 89 percent 
of children who attend public schools in our nation represent a multitude of diverse religions, 
ethnicities and backgrounds. For Secretary Paige to say that the upbringing of one class of children 
offers superior morality compared to other children is offensive and hurtful to people of all other 
persuasions in America." Secretary Page made the following remarks in an interview with a Baptist 
publication. "All things equal, I would prefer to have a child in a school that has a strong appreciation 
for the values of the Christian community, where a child is taught to have a strong faith," Questions
